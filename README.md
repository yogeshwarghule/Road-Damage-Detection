# Deep Learning Approach To Detect Road Surface Damage and Geo-tagging of Data

This project uses deep learning techniques to detect road surface damage and geo-tag collected data on a map to help authorities with road maintenance. Mobile sensors (GPS, camera) are used to collect data that is processed by a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify and detect surface damage.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Folium (for mapping)


### Installation

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:

pip install tensorflow numpy opencv-python folium


### Running the Code
```
To train the CNN:
```
python train.py


To test the CNN:
```
python test.py
```

To generate a map of geo-tagged data:
